# Fashion-Recommendation-System-using-Image-Features

his repository contains code to build a Fashion Recommendation System utilizing image features. The system leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze fashion items' visual aspects like color, texture, and style and recommend similar or complementary products to users.

## Overview

A Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features aims to provide personalized fashion suggestions to users based on their preferences and browsing history. It analyzes the visual characteristics of fashion items using deep learning models like VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3 and recommends similar items from a diverse dataset.

## Features

- Assemble a diverse dataset of fashion items, including various colors, patterns, styles, and categories.
- Implement a preprocessing function to prepare images for feature extraction.
- Choose a pre-trained CNN model (e.g., VGG16) to extract powerful feature representations from images.
- Extract features from fashion images and create a structured dataset of feature vectors.
- Define a metric (e.g., cosine similarity) to measure the similarity between feature vectors.
- Recommend top N fashion items similar to the input image based on feature similarities.
- Visualize the input image and its recommended items for user interaction.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)
